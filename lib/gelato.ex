defmodule Gelato do
  @moduledoc """
  `Gelato` is a opinionated [logger backend](https://hexdocs.pm/logger/Logger.html#module-backends)
  helper library to log events with [`telemetry`](https://hexdocs.pm/telemetry) attached.

  It is to be configured in `config.exs` in the following way:

  ```elixir
  config :gelato,
    uri: "http://127.0.0.1:9200",
    events: [:app, :lib],
    handler: :elastic

  config :logger,
    backends: [Gelato.Logger.Backend],
    level: :debug
  ```

  and might be used normally as a usual logger backend

  ```elixir
  Logger.info "users", name: "John", reference: "U-123456789"
  ```

  Basically, it logs the payload with the telemetry attached to the configured
  _ElasticSearch_ instance. The telemetry includes some process information
  by default, besides monotonic time and some additional parameters.

  The process info data might be altered or switched off by passing `:process_info`
  keyword parameter in call to `Logger.log/3`. `true` value (default) would
  collect and store the current process info; any other value would be passed through
  as is.

  * `level` parameter is one of `:debug | :info | :warn | :error`
  * `message` is mapped to ElasticSearch index when passed; possible values must be configured in `config.exs` file in the list of telemetry events
  * `payload` is a keyword list to be passed to _Elastic_

  Also it supports benchmarking with `#{__MODULE__}.bench/4`. The latter will
  execute the block passed to the function, surrounded with two calls to
  `Logger.log/3` to collect some additional info about this particular
  block execution.

  By default all the logger methods would attach `process_info` to the events
  sent to _Elastic_ to alter / discard this pass `process_info: SOMETHING` to
  the call to all the exported functionsâ€™ payload. Unless `SOMETHING` is `true`,
  this value will be used instead of real process info.

  Similar to `Logger.log/3` but accepts a block.

  The block will be executed, surrounded by calls to `log` and the
  telemetry data will be accumulated in the latter call.
